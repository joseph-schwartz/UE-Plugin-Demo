# UE-Plugin-Demo
This is a demonstration of an Unreal Engine plugin I built from scratch during my time at Infinite Games.  It works on both UE4 and UE5 (with few changes because of a current bug in UE5).  It handles UE HTTP calls for Login/Logout, Inventory Requests, and Join and Leave Queue calls (for a matchmaker).
